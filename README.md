## ‚ù§Ô∏è Community

I'm an infrastructure engineer with many years of experience building and operating production systems at scale.  
This project is my attempt to bring the best practices from enterprise environments into a fully self-hosted, transparent, and repeatable platform that anyone can run at home.

I created OurStack to share what I've learned ‚Äî and to make it easier for others to build reliable infrastructure without relying on external platforms or closed ecosystems.

If you find this project useful or inspiring, I'd love to hear from you.  
Feedback, ideas, and contributions are always welcome.  
Let‚Äôs build this together.
